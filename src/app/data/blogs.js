## Web3: Making Sense of the Crypto Jungle

This week, I dove headfirst into the world of Web3. It's wild, chaotic, but also incredibly fascinating. Here are some of the key things I learned:

- **Centralized vs Decentralized Exchanges (CEX vs DEX)**: I now understand how they operate differently, including concepts like **custodial risk**, **order books**, and **fees**.
- **Order Types**: Market order vs Limit order‚Äîsimple terms, but very different implications depending on volatility and slippage.
- **Liquidity and Depth**: These define how stable an exchange is for larger trades. Shallow depth = more price impact.
- **Slippage**: That annoying little hidden cost you notice only when it's already too late üòÖ.
- **Cold vs Hot Wallets**: Cold wallets = offline & safer. Hot wallets = online & faster, but also riskier.

Even if I‚Äôm not trading yet, it feels empowering to understand the backbone of Web3 infrastructure.

## React Query vs React.use

I‚Äôve always relied on \`useState\` + \`useEffect\` to fetch data, but **React Query** changes the game. Here‚Äôs how:

- It handles caching, loading, error, and refetching automatically.
- Works great with APIs, especially in apps where you‚Äôre reading remote data often.
- Less boilerplate than writing \`fetch\`, setting state, handling loading manually.

Pairing this with **tRPC** was an eye-opener. I don‚Äôt have to manually write API routes with \`fetch\`‚Äîjust define procedures and call them directly.

Also got more comfortable with React's experimental \`use()\` function‚Äîvery cool for reading async resources in server components.

## Next.js + TailwindCSS Deep Dive

- **Server Actions**: I explored this new way of handling mutations *on the server*, securely and without needing client-side API calls.
- **Next.js API routes vs tRPC**: Understanding when and why to use each helped me rethink my fullstack flow.
- **TailwindCSS \`data-*\` Attributes**: These let you style components conditionally based on data state, without adding extra JS or class toggling. Clean and powerful!

## Takeaway

Honestly, the amount of learning I crammed into one week surprised me. I‚Äôm starting to feel more confident navigating between frontend and backend concerns, and understanding what‚Äôs happening under the hood‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a React hook or a crypto exchange protocol.

These aren‚Äôt just ‚Äúbuzzwords‚Äù anymore‚Äîthey‚Äôre starting to click.

I‚Äôm building things with more intention now.`

Today I went to a tech meetup. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but it turned out to be a really good experience. I met a bunch of people‚Äîincluding a CTO‚Äîand had some surprisingly deep conversations. Even though his company isn‚Äôt hiring juniors, just talking to someone in that position felt encouraging.
      
Multiple people told me I seemed confident and outgoing. That meant a lot to hear, because it didn‚Äôt always feel that way internally. I think I‚Äôm learning to ‚Äúshow up‚Äù better in public‚Äîeven when I still have doubts or insecurities in private.
      
It felt like I was being two versions of myself: one that connects with people, laughs, shares; and another that goes home and sinks into quiet overthinking. Maybe both are real. I‚Äôm just learning how to hold space for both.
      
Sometimes it‚Äôs not about walking away with a job or a contact. Sometimes it‚Äôs just about proving to yourself that you can be part of the conversation.
      
And today, I was.`

        title: "Why I Built This Website",
        slug: "why-this-website",
        category: "reflection",
        excerpt: "This wasn‚Äôt just about making a portfolio‚Äîit was a mix of curiosity, frustration, and a strong urge to just make something of my own.",
        date: "2025-06-08",
        content: `## So... why this website?
      
Honestly? I was tired of feeling like I didn‚Äôt *have* something of my own online. A CV is flat. LinkedIn is performative. GitHub is chaotic. I wanted a place that felt like me‚Äîa space where I could collect the weird mix of things I‚Äôm learning, building, and thinking about.
      
It started with a vague idea: ‚ÄúI should probably have a portfolio.‚Äù But as I worked on it, it became something else. I realized I actually *enjoyed* building the site‚Äîdesigning it, tweaking little layout things, adding animations that made me smile.
      
Next.js taught me a lot about how modern web apps *should* be structured. The file-based routing just made sense. Getting SSR/SSG to work was a headache at first, but once I got it, it felt powerful. I used Tailwind CSS for styling because I like how fast I can go from idea to UI. It was messy at first (I resisted it for a long time), but it really clicked during this project. I also got better at thinking in components. Breaking things into small, reusable pieces is satisfying‚Äîlike Lego, but for interfaces.
      
## The real win
      
More than the tech stuff, I think the best thing this website gave me was *momentum*. I stopped waiting until I was ‚Äúready‚Äù to build something. I just‚Ä¶ started. And I learned a lot in the process‚Äînot just about code, but about what kind of developer I want to be.
      
That‚Äôs worth a lot.`
