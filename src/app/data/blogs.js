Today I went to a tech meetup. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but it turned out to be a really good experience. I met a bunch of people—including a CTO—and had some surprisingly deep conversations. Even though his company isn’t hiring juniors, just talking to someone in that position felt encouraging.
      
Multiple people told me I seemed confident and outgoing. That meant a lot to hear, because it didn’t always feel that way internally. I think I’m learning to “show up” better in public—even when I still have doubts or insecurities in private.
      
It felt like I was being two versions of myself: one that connects with people, laughs, shares; and another that goes home and sinks into quiet overthinking. Maybe both are real. I’m just learning how to hold space for both.
      
Sometimes it’s not about walking away with a job or a contact. Sometimes it’s just about proving to yourself that you can be part of the conversation.

        content: `## So... why this website?
      
Honestly? I was tired of feeling like I didn’t *have* something of my own online. A CV is flat. LinkedIn is performative. GitHub is chaotic. I wanted a place that felt like me—a space where I could collect the weird mix of things I’m learning, building, and thinking about.
      
It started with a vague idea: “I should probably have a portfolio.” But as I worked on it, it became something else. I realized I actually *enjoyed* building the site—designing it, tweaking little layout things, adding animations that made me smile.
      
Next.js taught me a lot about how modern web apps *should* be structured. The file-based routing just made sense. Getting SSR/SSG to work was a headache at first, but once I got it, it felt powerful. I used Tailwind CSS for styling because I like how fast I can go from idea to UI. It was messy at first (I resisted it for a long time), but it really clicked during this project. I also got better at thinking in components. Breaking things into small, reusable pieces is satisfying—like Lego, but for interfaces.
      
## The real win
      
More than the tech stuff, I think the best thing this website gave me was *momentum*. I stopped waiting until I was “ready” to build something. I just… started. And I learned a lot in the process—not just about code, but about what kind of developer I want to be.
      
That’s worth a lot.`
